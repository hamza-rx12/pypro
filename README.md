# Project Name

Image Master is an image processing GUI app built using tkinter.  


## Requirements

```
#Tkinter
pip install tkinter

#CustomTkinter
pip install customtkinter

#Numpy
pip install numpy

#OpenCV
pip install opencv-python

#Pillow
pip install Pillow

```
## Usage

Make sure you have python version >= 3.10 .  
Clone the repository on your local machine:  
` git clone https://github.com/hamza-rx12/pypro.git `  


Execute the **Image_Master.py** file:  
` python3 Image_Master.py`  

## Notice

It is not advised to use conda, we tried it but it has no support of the customtkinter widgets.  
It will still work but the GUI will not be as expected.
